Django has its own ORM

SQLite in dev, Postgres in prod ???

new tables (classes) go into `models.py`

We can do some queries from the interactive shell `python .\manage.py shell` â€” see video for detailed demo.

We can also open up a connection to Dbeaver with [./db.sqlite3](./db.sqlite3) and do stuff from there:

If we add `admin.site.register(Post)` to `admin.py` we gain access to admin tools for managing Posts:
